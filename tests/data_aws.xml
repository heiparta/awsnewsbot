With Amazon Lex, you can quickly and easily build sophisticated, natural language, conversational bots (“chatbots”), virtual agents, and IVR systems. Today, Amazon Lex introduces grammar slot type. You can now you can author your own grammar in the XML format per the &lt;a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Speech Recognition Grammar Specification&lt;/a&gt; (SRGS) to collect information in a conversation.

You can use the slot type to port your existing grammars to Amazon Lex. Alternately, you can choose from a list of pre-built industry grammars commonly used in domains such as financial services, insurance, and telecom. The grammar slot type provides granular control for collecting and post-processing user input so you can manage an effective dialog.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 21:09:35 +0000</pubDate><category>general:products/amazon-lex,marketing:marchitecture/artificial-intelligence</category><author>aws@amazon.com</author></item><item><link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/amazon-transcribe-call-analytics-machine-learning-call-summarization/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">fe02a75f66f04f5e8dce63b0902c64174b016e4d</guid><title>Amazon Transcribe Call Analytics now supports machine-learning powered call summarization</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon Transcribe Call Analytics announces support for call summarization, a machine learning (ML) capability that helps improve the productivity of contact center agents and managers so they can focus on providing excellent customer experiences.

Additionally, when you add and remove accounts, policies that include the aws:PrincipalOrgID key should automatically include the correct accounts and help minimize manual updating.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 22:34:53 +0000</pubDate><category>general:products/aws-lambda,general:products/aws-iam,marketing:marchitecture/compute,marketing:marchitecture/developer-tools,marketing:marchitecture/management-and-governance,marketing:marchitecture/containers,marketing:marchitecture/security-identity-and-compliance,marketing:marchitecture/serverless</category><author>aws@amazon.com</author></item><item><link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/03/aws-glue-databrew-supports-cross-account-glue-data-catalog-s3-access/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">0ad01f2dd6053c7113ac14498c52835a3a39ff0e</guid><title>AWS Glue DataBrew now supports cross-account Glue Data Catalog S3 access</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/glue/features/databrew/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;AWS Glue DataBrew&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;customers are now able to access AWS Glue Data Catalog S3 tables from other AWS accounts if an appropriate resource policy is created in the AWS Glue console.

Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for &lt;a href="http://activemq.apache.org/components/classic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Apache ActiveMQ&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that makes it easier to set up and operate message brokers on AWS. You can reduce your operational burden by using Amazon MQ to manage the provisioning, setup, and maintenance of message brokers. Because Amazon MQ connects to your current applications with industry-standard APIs and protocols, you can more easily migrate to AWS without having to rewrite code.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 18:12:14 +0000</pubDate><category>general:products/amazon-mq,general:products/application-integration,marketing:marchitecture/application-services</category><author>aws@amazon.com</author></item><item><link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/ec2-hibernation-asia-regions/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">dbb39b360dfbba5bac273bb124b30b2dbe8d4844</guid><title>EC2 Hibernation is now available in the Asia Pacific (Jakarta) and (Osaka) AWS Regions</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The EC2 Hibernation feature is now available in the Asia Pacific (Jakarta) and (Osaka) AWS Regions. Hibernation gives you the ability to launch EC2 instances, set them up as desired, and then pause and resume them again whenever you need to. Your instances and applications will pick up right where they left off instead of rebuilding their memory footprint from a cold boot. Hibernation enables you to maintain a fleet of pre-warmed instances, getting you to a productive state in less time and without modifying your existing applications. Hibernation is available for instances running &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Hibernate.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;OSes.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 20:43:14 +0000</pubDate><category>general:products/amazon-ec2,marketing:marchitecture/compute,marketing:marchitecture/developer-tools</category><author>aws@amazon.com</author></item><item><link>https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/02/amazon-finspace-user-apis/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">ba5151e5e2a4dc82af5c8b5c290824b189e6b007</guid><title>Amazon FinSpace releases new User APIs</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Amazon FinSpace customers can now manage their Amazon FinSpace application users with the AWS SDK and CLI. Using these APIs, customers can integrate Amazon FinSpace into their identity management provisioning process to help Amazon FinSpace meet their organization’s access management rules. For example, when a user joins a quantitative research team that uses FinSpace, they can have a user account in FinSpace automatically created. Similarly, when a user leaves the customer’s organization or switches roles, they can be automatically deactivated in FinSpace as part of their organization-wide application entitlement workflows. This new feature adds to Amazon FinSpace’s existing single-sign-on capability to give customers more effective controls to manage access.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 22:22:14 +0000</pubDate><category>marketing:marchitecture/analytics,general:products/amazon-finspace</category><author>aws@amazon.com</author></item></channel></rss>
